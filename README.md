# Settyl
There are two branches one main and other chatbot
In main all files of myproject are there and in chatbot all files of my app are present

I have removed the API key for security reasons...kindly enter one before running the application.
I used Gemini AI so the API key will be available in gemini API.
Enter the API key in chatbot->views.py inside a function named get_gemini_response()-> Headers-> Authorization.
Write the key here: "Bearers --(your API key)--".
